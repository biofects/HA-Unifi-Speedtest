# üåê UniFi Speedtest for Home Assistant

## üîç About

This Home Assistant custom integration provides real-time speed test monitoring for UniFi networks with **enhanced dual WAN support**. It supports all UniFi platforms including UDM Pro, UDM SE, Cloud Key, and traditional UniFi Controller software, allowing you to track download speed, upload speed, and ping directly within Home Assistant.

**üÜï NEW: Multi-WAN Detection** - Automatically detects and creates separate sensors for each WAN interface in dual WAN setups, solving the issue where both WANs showed identical speeds.

## üì∏ Screenshots

### Configuration
Configure multi-WAN support during setup to enable separate monitoring for each WAN interface:

![Multi-WAN Configuration](images/configwan.png)

### Dual WAN Monitoring in Action
See how the integration creates separate sensors for each WAN interface, providing individual speed metrics:

#### WAN 1 Sensors
Monitor your primary WAN connection with dedicated sensors for download, upload, and ping:

![WAN 1 Sensors](images/wan1.png)

#### WAN 2 Sensors  
Track your secondary WAN connection independently with its own set of performance metrics:

![WAN 2 Sensors](images/wan2.png)

*Notice how each WAN interface gets its own sensors, solving the issue where dual WAN setups previously showed identical speeds for both connections.*

*The integration now works seamlessly with both UDM Pro and traditional UniFi Controllers, providing regular speed test data with proper Home Assistant unit standards.*

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**403 Forbidden Error**: 
- Verify your username/password are correct
- Ensure the user account has admin privileges
- For UDM Pro: Disable 2FA temporarily or create a local admin user

**Connection Refused**:
- Check the URL format matches your controller type
- Verify the controller is accessible from Home Assistant
- Check firewall settings

**No Speed Test Data**:
- Ensure at least one speed test has been run on your controller
- Traditional controllers: Use the `start_speed_test` service
- UDM Pro: Run a speed test via the web interface first

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_unifi_speedtest: debug
```
