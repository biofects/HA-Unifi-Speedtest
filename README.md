# 🌐 UniFi Speedtest for Home Assistant

## 🔍 About

This Home Assistant custom integration provides real-time speed test monitoring for UniFi networks with **enhanced dual WAN support**. It supports all UniFi platforms including UDM Pro, UDM SE, Cloud Key, and traditional UniFi Controller software, allowing you to track download speed, upload speed, and ping directly within Home Assistant.

**🆕 NEW: Multi-WAN Detection** - Automatically detects and creates separate sensors for each WAN interface in dual WAN setups, solving the issue where both WANs showed identical speeds.

### Dual WAN Monitoring in Action
See how the integration creates separate sensors for each WAN interface, providing individual speed metrics:

#### WAN 1 Sensors
Monitor your primary WAN connection with dedicated sensors for download, upload, and ping:

![WAN 1 Sensors](images/wan1.png)

#### WAN 2 Sensors  
Track your secondary WAN connection independently with its own set of performance metrics:

## 📡 Sensors

### Single WAN Setup
The integration creates three sensors for monitoring network performance:

- **UniFi Speed Test Download Speed** (Mbit/s)
- **UniFi Speed Test Upload Speed** (Mbit/s)  
- **UniFi Speed Test Ping** (ms)

### 🆕 Dual WAN Setup
For multi-WAN configurations, separate sensors are created for each WAN interface:

**WAN 1:**
- **UniFi Speed Test Download Speed WAN** (Mbit/s)
- **UniFi Speed Test Upload Speed WAN** (Mbit/s)  
- **UniFi Speed Test Ping WAN** (ms)

**WAN 2:**
- **UniFi Speed Test Download Speed WAN2** (Mbit/s)
- **UniFi Speed Test Upload Speed WAN2** (Mbit/s)  
- **UniFi Speed Test Ping WAN2** (ms)

### Additional Sensors
- **UniFi Speed Test Runs**: Track total number of speed tests performed
- **UniFi API Health**: Monitor integration connection status

### 🏷️ Sensor Attributes

Each multi-WAN sensor includes additional attributes:
- `interface_name`: Physical interface (e.g., "eth9", "eth10")
- `wan_networkgroup`: WAN group name (e.g., "WAN", "WAN2")
- `wan_number`: Sequential WAN number
- `total_wan_interfaces`: Total detected WAN interfaces
- `is_primary_wan`: Boolean indicating primary WAN (intelligently determined from routing/config)
- `timestamp`: Last speedtest timestamp
- `status`: Interface status

**Note on `is_primary_wan`**: This attribute now reflects the **actual** primary WAN as configured in your UniFi controller, not just the first physical port detected. If you've configured a secondary port (like SFP+ port 2) as your primary WAN, that interface will correctly show `is_primary_wan: true`.

## 🔧 Services

### `ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test`

Initiates a speed test on your UniFi network.

**Note**: Only available for traditional UniFi Controller software. UDM Pro users must start speed tests manually via the UniFi Network web interface.

#### Example Usage:

**In Automations:**
```yaml
action:
  - service: ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test
```

**In Scripts:**
```yaml
test_network_speed:
  sequence:
    - service: ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test
    - delay: "00:02:00"  # Wait for test to complete
    - service: notify.mobile_app
      data:
        message: "Speed test completed. Download: {{ states('sensor.unifi_speed_test_download_speed') }} Mbps"
```

**Lovelace Button:**
```yaml
type: button

tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test
```

### `ha_unifi_speedtest.get_speed_test_status`

Manually refreshes speed test data from your UniFi controller.

---

*The integration now works seamlessly with both UDM Pro and traditional UniFi Controllers, providing regular speed test data with proper Home Assistant unit standards.*

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**403 Forbidden Error**: 
- Verify your username/password are correct
- Ensure the user account has admin privileges
- For UDM Pro: Disable 2FA temporarily or create a local admin user

**Connection Refused**:
- Check the URL format matches your controller type
- Verify the controller is accessible from Home Assistant
- Check firewall settings

**No Speed Test Data**:
- Ensure at least one speed test has been run on your controller
- Traditional controllers: Use the `start_speed_test` service
- UDM Pro: Run a speed test via the web interface first

### Primary WAN Detection Issues

The integration now uses **intelligent primary WAN detection** to properly identify which WAN interface is actually your primary connection, even if you've configured a secondary port (like SFP+ port 2) as your primary WAN.

**Primary WAN Detection Methods** (in order of priority):
1. **Routing Table Analysis**: Checks the default route (0.0.0.0/0) to identify which interface handles the primary traffic
2. **Network Configuration**: Looks for explicitly configured primary WAN settings in the UniFi controller
3. **Speed Test Data**: Uses the WAN interface with the most recent and complete speed test data
4. **Fallback**: Uses the first detected interface (legacy behavior)

**If Primary WAN Detection is Incorrect**:

1. **Check UniFi Network Settings**: 
   - Verify that your desired primary WAN is correctly configured in the UniFi Network application
   - Ensure the routing table reflects your intended primary WAN

2. **Check Integration Logs**:
   - Enable debug logging (see below)
   - Look for messages like: "Primary WAN determined from routing table: eth9_WAN"
   - The logs will show which detection method was used

3. **Check Sensor Attributes**:
   - Go to Developer Tools > States
   - Find your UniFi speed test sensors
   - Check if `is_primary_wan` is correct on your configured primary WAN

**Expected Behavior**:
- The WAN interface you've configured as primary in UniFi should show `is_primary_wan: true`
- That interface should have the speed test results
- Other WAN interfaces should show `is_primary_wan: false`
- Devices and sensors will be named "Primary WAN" and "Secondary WAN"

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_unifi_speedtest: debug
```
