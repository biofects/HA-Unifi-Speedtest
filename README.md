## üîß Services

### `ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test`

Initiates a speed test on your UniFi network.

**Note**: Only available for traditional UniFi Controller software. UDM Pro users must start speed tests manually via the UniFi Network web interface.

#### Example Usage:

**In Automations:**
```yaml
action:
  - service: ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test
```

**In Scripts:**
```yaml
test_network_speed:
  sequence:
    - service: ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test
    - delay: "00:02:00"  # Wait for test to complete
    - service: notify.mobile_app
      data:
        message: "Speed test completed. Download: {{ states('sensor.unifi_speed_test_download_speed') }} Mbps"
```

**Lovelace Button:**
```yaml
type: button
name: Start Speed Test
tap_action:
  action: call-service
  service: ha_unifi_speedtest.start_speed_test
```

### `ha_unifi_speedtest.get_speed_test_status`

Manually refreshes speed test data from your UniFi controller.

## üìä Example Dashboard

```yaml
type: entities
title: Network Speed Test
entities:
  - entity: sensor.unifi_speed_test_download_speed
    name: Download Speed
  - entity: sensor.unifi_speed_test_upload_speed  
    name: Upload Speed
  - entity: sensor.unifi_speed_test_ping
    name: Ping
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**403 Forbidden Error**: 
- Verify your username/password are correct
- Ensure the user account has admin privileges
- For UDM Pro: Disable 2FA temporarily or create a local admin user

**Connection Refused**:
- Check the URL format matches your controller type
- Verify the controller is accessible from Home Assistant
- Check firewall settings

**No Speed Test Data**:
- Ensure at least one speed test has been run on your controller
- Traditional controllers: Use the `start_speed_test` service
- UDM Pro: Run a speed test via the web interface first

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_unifi_speedtest: debug
```
